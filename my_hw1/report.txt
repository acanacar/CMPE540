//How did i describe state?

states are defined as tuple whose first item as x-coordinate of cleaner location , second item as y-coordinate of cleaner location,
third item as dictionary consisting of location of dirt (key) and the dirt amount at this (value).


//How many states?

cleaner can be any location in grid matrix.
cleaner positions -> m * n

Amount of dirts can be 9 as max. So we can think amount of dirts as 9 and dirts can be in any location in grid matrix.
dirts' positions -> (m * n)^^9

total states = (m*n)^^10


//What is A*2 heuristic function?

value of heuristic function is the euclidean distance to the nearest dirt point which is determined by manhattan distance.
